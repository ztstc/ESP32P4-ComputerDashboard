# ESP-Hosted-MCU Wi-Fi Design & Implementation details


## Sequence Diagram for Wi-Fi communication

On a ESP chipset with native Wi-Fi, a Wi-Fi api call or network data
from the application is processed internally on the chip and a Wi-Fi
response is returned to the application.

```mermaid

    box rgb(128, 128, 128) Host With Native WI-Fi
    participant app as Application
    participant api as ESP-IDF Wi-Fi Library
    participant wifi as Wi-Fi Hardware
    end

    app ->> api : esp_wifi_xxx() or Network Data
    api ->> wifi : 
    Note over wifi : Do Wi-Fi action
    wifi -->> api : Wi-Fi response or Data
    api -->> app : Response or Network Data
```

Using Wi-Remote and ESP-Hosted, the Wi-Fi api call from the
application is converted into a Hosted Call and transported to the
slave. The slave converts the Hosted Call back into an Wi-Fi api
call. The response (optionally with data) is converted into a Hosted
Response and transported back to the host. On the host, the Hosted
Response is converted back into a Wi-Fi response (optionally with
data) is returned to the application.

For Network Data, Hosted does not do data conversion and only
encapsulates the data for transport.

    box rgb(128, 128, 128) Host with ESP-Hosted
    participant app as Application
    participant remote as Wi-Fi Remote
    participant hostedh as ESP-Hosted
    participant transporth as Host Transport
    end

    box rgb(128, 128, 128) Slave ESP-Hosted
    participant transports as Slave Transport
    participant hosteds as Slave Hosted
    participant api as ESP-IDF Wi-Fi Library
    participant wifi as Wi-Fi Hardware
    end

    app ->> remote : esp_wifi_xxx()
    remote ->> hostedh : esp_wifi_remote_xxx()
    app ->> hostedh : Network Data
    Note over hostedh : add Hosted header
    hostedh ->> transporth : 

    transporth ->> transports : SPI/SDIO

    transports ->> hosteds : 
    Note over hosteds : remove Hosted header
    hosteds ->> api : esp_wifi_xxx()
    hosteds ->> wifi : Network Data
    api ->> wifi : Wi-Fi command or Data
    Note over wifi: Do Wi-Fi action
    wifi -->> api : Wi-Fi response or Data
    wifi -->> hosteds : Network Data
    api -->> hosteds : Response
    Note over hosteds : add Hosted header
    hosteds -->> transports : 

    transports -->> transporth : SPI/SDIO

    transporth -->> hostedh : 
    Note over hostedh : remove Hosted header
    hostedh -->> app : Network Data
    hostedh -->> remote : Wi-Fi Command response
    remote -->> app : Response
```
